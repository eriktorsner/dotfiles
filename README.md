# .files

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

It mainly targets macOS systems


## Installation

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS. First sign in to your Apple ID so that mas app manager can install App Store Apps. Then at the command prompt:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

Since we're lazy, add passwordless sudo

```bash
export VISUAL=nano
sudo visudo /etc/sudoers.d/wheel
```

add the line 

```bash
%wheel    ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL
```

The Xcode Command Line Tools includes `git` and `make` (not available on stock macOS). Now there are two options:

Alternatively, clone manually into the desired location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eriktorsner/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```


Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to install everything [listed above](#package-overview), and symlink [runcom](./runcom)
and [config](./config) (using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)):

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
make
```
